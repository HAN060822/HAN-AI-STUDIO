# Prototype 0 Architecture Baseline

## Selected stack

- **Language:** strict TypeScript for browser and local application code.
- **Web UI:** React with Vite.
- **Local runtime:** Node.js; server-side modules arrive only with a vertical feature that needs them.
- **Structured persistence:** SQLite behind repository interfaces, introduced in Stage 2.
- **File persistence:** ignored `var/` storage for artifacts, checkpoints, exports, and logs.
- **Testing:** Vitest, jsdom, and Testing Library.
- **Desktop path:** a thin Tauri or equivalent wrapper may host the built web UI later; Stage 0 does not lock one in.

This stack is web-first and produces portable static assets. One TypeScript repository and deployable application preserve a modular monolith while allowing shared contracts without coupling the domain to React. SQLite and filesystem storage support local ownership. Explicit ports will isolate providers and connectors. One fast test command covers browser-facing and dependency-free domain code.

## Dependency direction

```text
web/app -> application use cases -> core domain + ports
                                  <- provider adapters
                                  <- external connectors
                                  <- SQLite/filesystem storage
```

The UI may call application use cases, never provider SDKs, SQLite, or Obsidian directly. Core modules may not import UI, storage, provider, or connector implementations. Agent, provider, and model identities remain separate. Conversation, task, execution, and knowledge remain separate concepts even when a screen composes them.

## Intended module growth

Stage 1 keeps its exercised product-shell code in `src/app`. Cohesive `core`, `application`, `agents`, `orchestrator`, `execution`, `context`, `knowledge`, `permissions`, `observability`, `adapters`, `connectors`, and `storage` modules are added when first used. This reserves boundaries without empty architecture scaffolding.

## Application/data separation

Tracked source and configuration stay in the repository. Mutable user data defaults to `./var`, configurable through `HAN_AI_STUDIO_DATA_DIR`, and is ignored except for `var/.gitkeep`. Production output goes to ignored `dist/`. Secrets belong in ignored environment files or a future OS-backed facility; they must never use `VITE_*`, because Vite embeds those values in browser assets.

## Stage 0 decisions

1. Use one TypeScript package while Prototype 0 remains a modular monolith.
2. Use React/Vite without a full-stack meta-framework so local runtime boundaries remain explicit.
3. Defer the SQLite library choice to Stage 2, when runtime and packaging constraints can be tested together.
4. Defer the desktop wrapper choice until validated workflows expose required native capabilities.
5. Add dependencies and modules only when a vertical stage exercises them.
